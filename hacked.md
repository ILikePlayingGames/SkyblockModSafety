# What to do if You've Been Hacked

1. Disable Multiplayer on your Minecraft account. This prevents the hacker from logging into servers. Your Minecraft account must be a Microsoft account to do this.
   1. Go to your Xbox settings: https://account.xbox.com/settings
   2. Select "Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Windows 10 devices Online Safety"

# Notes
If the hacker has taken your Skyblock items, unfortunately there is nothing you can do. Hypixel does not restore Skyblock items under any circumstance[^1].
If the hacker has gotten your account banned by hacking on it, unfortunately you'll have to wait out your ban. According to Hypixel, what happens on your account is your responsibility, no matter who was using it[^2].
