# Common Token Logger Strategies
- Offering paid mods (like SBE) or private mods for free
    - It may seem like a good deal but what sounds too good to be true usually is.
    - Sometimes they may offer to give one to you if you beat them in a duel to make it sound more convincing. These are most likely token loggers.

- Token loggers disguised as popular mods
    - Token loggers are usually disguised as a popular mod (like SBA or NEU).
- Offering to send a new update of a mod in DMs
    - Please don't download files from random people.
- Offering hacks with a flashy feature list
    - Don't download hacks at all. They are not allowed on Skyblock and it's difficult to know what's in them. You may get banned or have your account stolen.
    - Token logger makers sometimes disguise their mods as hacks such as macros, auction flippers, and dungeon solvers.
    - They'll advertise impressive features such as making billions of coins in a day. These are fake claims to lure people in.
- They are usually high-level players
    - They target high-level players to steal their wealth so they often have high stats themselves to blend in with their prey.
    - They often look for victims in areas high-level players frequent (like Crystal Hollows or F7 dungeon parties).
- Impersonating people you trust
    - They have been seen to impersonate high-ranking community members such as staff members from Skyblock Discord communities.
    - They impersonate the owners of accounts they have stolen to convince the owner's friends to download token loggers.
- Random direct messages
    - They sometimes randomly DM people in Skyblock Discord servers offering to send a mod. Ignore and report these messages to the server staff and Discord.
- Advertising in in-game lobbies
    - They also advertise in Skyblock lobbies like the hub, asking anyone who wants a free mod to message them.
- Playing and talking with victims to gain their trust
    - They will play through several dungeon runs and chat with other players for some time before offering the token logger. They do this to gain trust so people will be more likely to download the token logger.
- Saying the file is marked safe on VirusTotal
    - They use VirusTotal to convince people the file is safe. In reality, this is misleading as VirusTotal cannot detect Minecraft token loggers.
- Offering to pay you to test their mod
    - Sometimes they'll offer to pay you coins to download the mod. This is a ruse since they'll just take over your account after you run the mod.

- Pretending to be an official discord bot of a mod and advertising a supposed mod update in DMs
    - Mod creators never share mod updates in DMs. They will always be posted in an announcement channel on the mod's official Discord server
