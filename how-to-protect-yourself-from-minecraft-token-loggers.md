## What is a Token Logger?
A token logger (or stealer) is a malicious Minecraft mod that is designed to steal your Minecraft (also Discord or other apps sometimes) session token. This token is a line of text stored on your computer that the Minecraft client uses to login to the game. It exists so you don't have to enter your username and password every time you want to login to the game. If your token is stolen by a token logger, then the author of the token logger will be able to use it to login to your account.

## How Do They Spread?
Token loggers are often spread in dungeon parties, in public Skyblock lobbies, on Skyblock Discord servers, or in Discord direct messages. Often token logger makers will offer to send you a new version of a popular mod or a paid mod for free. They will ask you for your Discord name to send you the file over direct message in Discord. Read the next section for a list of the specific tactics they use.

## How Do I Protect Myself?
1. **Never download mods from other people**. This is the best thing you can do to protect yourself. It doesn't matter if they're a friend, a Youtuber, or a high level player. Always download mods from official sources like the mod's GitHub page or Discord server.
2. Watch out for these common tactics token logger makers use:
    - Offering paid mods (like SBE) or private mods for free
        - It may seem like a good deal but what sounds too good to be true usually is.
    - Token loggers disguised as popular mods
        - Token loggers are usually disguised as a popular mod (like SBA or NEU).
    - Offering hacks with a flashy feature list
        - Don't download hacks at all. They are not allowed on Skyblock and it's difficult to know what's in them. You may get banned or have your account stolen.
        - Token logger makers sometimes disguise their mods as hacks such as macros, auction flippers, and dungeon solvers.
        - They'll advertise impressive features such as making billions of coins in a day. These are fake claims to lure people in.
    - They are usually high-level players
        - They target high-level players to steal their wealth so they often have high stats themselves to blend in with their prey.
        - They often look for victims in areas high-level players frequent (like Crystal Hollows or F7 dungeon parties).
    - Impersonating people you trust
        - They have been seen to impersonate high-ranking community members such as staff members from Skyblock Discord communities.
        - They impersonate the owners of accounts they have stolen to convince the owner's friends to download token loggers.
    - Random direct messages
        - They sometimes randomly DM people in Skyblock Discord servers offering to send a mod. Ignore and report these messages to the server staff and Discord.
    - Advertising in in-game lobbies
        - They also advertise in Skyblock lobbies like the hub, asking anyone who wants a free mod to message them.
    - Playing and talking with victims to gain their trust
        - They will play through several dungeon runs and chat with other players for some time before offering the token logger. They do this to gain trust so people will be more likely to download the token logger.
    - Saying the file is marked safe on VirusTotal
        - They use VirusTotal to convince people the file is safe. In reality, this is misleading as VirusTotal cannot detect Minecraft token loggers.
    - Offering to pay you to test their mod
        - Sometimes they'll offer to pay you coins to download the mod. This is a ruse since they'll just take over your account after you run the mod.
3. Warn others. If you see someone offering to send mods, warn the other people in the party/lobby/etc. where they are offering it about the dangers and tell them not to download it.
4. If you see it, report it. It is important to report their messages so moderators can take action and prevent them from sending more.

## How Do I Report a Token Logger?
If someone offered to send you a mod, you can report it by following the instructions below.

### In-Game on Hypixel
1. Run the command `/report <username>` replacing `<username>` with the username of the person who sent the message.

You can see what servers you have in common by clicking on "Mutual Servers" at the beginning of your direct message, like the screenshot below.
