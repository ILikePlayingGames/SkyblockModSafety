## What is a Token Logger?
A token logger (or stealer) is a malicious Minecraft mod that is designed to steal your Minecraft (also Discord or other apps sometimes) session token. This token is a line of text stored on your computer that the Minecraft client uses to login to the game. It exists so you don't have to enter your username and password every time you want to login to the game. If your token is stolen by a token logger, then the author of the token logger will be able to use it to login to your account.

## How Do They Spread?
Token loggers are often spread in dungeon parties, in public Skyblock lobbies, on Skyblock Discord servers, or in Discord direct messages. Often token logger makers will offer to send you a new version of a popular mod or a paid mod for free. They will ask you for your Discord name to send you the file over direct message in Discord. Read the next section for a list of the specific tactics they use.

## How Do I Protect Myself?
1. **Never download mods from other people**. This is the best thing you can do to protect yourself. It doesn't matter if they're a friend, a Youtuber, or a high level player. Always download mods from official sources like the mod's GitHub page or Discord server.
2. Watch out for [these common tactics](common-token-logger-strategies.md) token logger makers use.
3. Warn others. If you see someone offering to send mods, warn the other people in the party/lobby/etc. where they are offering it about the dangers and tell them not to download it.
4. If you see it, report it. It is important to report their messages so moderators can take action and prevent them from sending more.

## How Do I Report a Token Logger?
If someone offered to send you a mod, you can report it by following the instructions below.

### In-Game on Hypixel
1. Run the command `/report <username>` replacing `<username>` with the username of the person who sent the message.

### In Discord
1. If the person who messaged you is in one or more Discord servers that you're also in, message a staff member on those servers and tell them someone tried to send you a malicious mod. They will ask you for more details and remove that person from the server once they have enough evidence. You can see what servers you have in common by clicking on "Mutual Servers" at the beginning of your direct message, like the screenshot below.
